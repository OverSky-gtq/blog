abstract = {Reliable and accurate position information is of great importance for many mass-market and emerging applications. Network localization and navigation (NLN) is a promising paradigm to provide such information ubiquitously, where a network of nodes is used to aid in localizing its members. This paper explores various network operation strategies, which play an essential role in NLN as they determine the network lifetime and localization accuracy. Efficient network operation requires several functionalities, including node prioritization, node activation, and node deployment. The roles of these functionalities are described and different techniques for implementing respective functionalities via algorithmic modules are introduced. Some important concepts such as cooperative operation, robustness guarantee, and distributed design in the development of the network operation strategies are also introduced. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the localization performance improvement attributed to the optimized network operation strategies.},

Hence, new applications such as wireless localization based aerial robot control or high precision personal safety tracking are developed. However, most of the current developments and research solely focus on the accuracy of the required localization systems. Multi-user scalability, energy efficiency and real-time capabilities are often neglected. This work aims to overcome the technology barrier by providing scalable, high accuracy, real-time localization through energy-efficient, scheduled time-difference of arrival channel access. We could show that simultaneous processing and provisioning of more than a thousand localization results per second with high reliability is possible using the proposed approach. To enable wide-spread adoption, we provide an open source implementation of our system for the robot operating system (ROS). Furthermore, we provide open source access to the raw data created during our evaluation.},

abstract = {We propose Chorus, a new ultra-wideband (UWB) localization scheme in which the target device computes the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of signals sent concurrently by localization anchors in known positions. This scheme, similar to GPS, is the opposite of existing TDOA schemes for UWB, where the target transmits the signal and anchors compute the time difference. This reversed perspective enables several advantages in Chorus, including support for countless targets. The cornerstone and novelty of Chorus is the use of concurrent transmissions from anchors; distance information is acquired at the receiver based on the channel impulse response (CIR) resulting from the fused signals. We contribute i) an analytical model enabling a priori estimation of the CIR resulting from the superposition of concurrent signals ii) techniques to accurately extract the time-of-flight information necessary for localization from the measured CIR, and iii) real-world experiments that validate the model as well as assess the practical feasibility and performance of Chorus. Experiments with the DW1000 UWB chip show that Chorus achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy. However, our model shows that performance is limited by idiosyncrasies of the DW1000 that, if removed in next-generation UWB hardware, could unlock an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy.},

The collaboration of multiple UAVs, which is also known as aerial swarm is a highly complex system, which still lacks a state-of-art decentralized relative state estimation method. In this paper, we present a novel fully decentralized visual-inertial-UWB fusion framework for relative state estimation and demonstrate the practicability by performing extensive aerial swarm flight experiments. The comparison result with ground truth data from the motion capture system shows the centimeter-level precision which outperforms all the Ultra-WideBand (UWB) and even vision based method. The system is not limited by the field of view (FoV) of the camera or Global Positioning System (GPS), meanwhile on account of its estimation consistency, we believe that the proposed relative state estimation framework has the potential to be prevalently adopted by aerial swarm applications in different scenarios in multiple scales.},

To this end, we follow an experiment-driven approach and show that i) different pulse repetition frequencies virtually double the number of non-interfering channels, ii) concurrent transmissions with different preamble codes are unreliable, unless transmitters are tightly synchronized, and iii) under the same RF configuration, UWB radios are very likely to receive one of the packets transmitted concurrently by multiple senders, unlocking opportunities similar to those exploited in low-power narrowband radios.

abstract = {Concurrent ranging exploits features of the channel impulse response (CIR) of received packets to allow an ultra-wideband (UWB) initiator node to concurrently measure the distance from multiple UWB responder nodes. Concurrent ranging enables indoor localization systems to reduce the required number of ranging packet exchanges, leading to less air utilization and energy consumption, and faster location update rate. Despite the research in this area, it is still challenging to build a practical UWB concurrent ranging system for real-world environments. Existing concurrent ranging solutions are not scalable because (1) they require strong assumptions about either the responders or the environment and (2) they fail to maintain the ranging accuracy in longer distances due to errors caused by clock drift. In this work, we present R3, a Reflection Resilient Ranging solution, to address these critical scalability issues in UWB concurrent ranging. R3 makes use of the difference in the time deviation of ranging signals to detect concurrent responders and it is equipped with a clock skew correction method that enables accurate concurrent ranging in long distances. We evaluate R3 using Decawave DW1000 UWB chip by deploying the radio nodes in an office environment. Our results show that R3 effectively detects concurrent ranging peaks in the presence of strong multipath. When we equip R3 with a clock skew correction method, it reduces the concurrent ranging error induced by clock drift by at least 54 cm in long distances ({\textgreater}50 m) and by more than 97{\%} in average when the ranging response delay is arbitrarily large.},

To this end, SnapLoc leverages (quasi-)simultaneous responses of multiple anchors. Based on these responses, the tag derives the time difference of arrival between anchors and unambiguously estimates its position. Thanks to this principle, SnapLoc carries out passive localization and supports an unlimited number of tags at high update rates. Our SnapLoc implementation runs on the off-the-shelf Decawave DW1000 UWB transceiver. The latter suffers from a limited transmit timestamp resolution that affects the achievable localization accuracy when used in conjunction with concurrent anchor responses. Therefore, in this demo we also showcase techniques to overcome these limitations and achieve nevertheless a high localization accuracy.},

State of the art UWB ranging applications can estimate the distances with less than a 5 cm error. Existing localization solutions create their own ranging traffic. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of piggybacking the information required by ranging application over existing network traffic. In addition, we study the feasibility of piggybacking of sensing information over ranging traffic and finally, we propose our technique for Simultaneous Ranging and Communication (SRAC) in UWB networks which adaptively changes the ranging mode from active to passive by using either ranging traffic or sensing traffic to accomplish the ranging and sensing goals while reducing the network traffic to minimum possible. We integrated our proposed solution to RIOT operating system and evaluated its performance over a mesh of UWB-enabled nodes. Our results indicate almost 40{\%} reduction in network traffic.},

abstract = {We propose a novel concurrent ranging technique for distance estimation with ultra-wideband (UWB) radios. Conventional schemes assume that the necessary packet exchanges occur in isolation, to avoid collisions. Concurrent ranging relies on the overlapping of replies from nearby responders to the same ranging request issued by an initiator node. As UWB transmissions rely on short pulses, the individual times of arrival can be discriminated by examining the channel impulse response (CIR) of the initiator transceiver. By ranging against N responders with a single, concurrent exchange, our technique drastically abates network overhead, enabling higher ranging frequency with lower latency and energy consumption w.r.t. conventional schemes. Concurrent ranging can be implemented with a strawman approach requiring minimal changes to standard schemes. Nevertheless, we empirically show that this limits the attainable accuracy, reliability, and therefore applicability. We identify the main challenges in realizing concurrent ranging without dedicated hardware and tackle them by contributing several techniques, used in synergy in our prototype based on the popular DW1000 transceiver. Our evaluation, with static targets and a mobile robot, confirms that concurrent ranging reliably achieves decimeter-level distance and position accuracy, comparable to conventional schemes but at a fraction of the network and energy cost.},
